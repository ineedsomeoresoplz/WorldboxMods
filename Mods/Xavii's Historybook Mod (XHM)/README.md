# Xavii's Historybook Mod (XHM)

A Worldbox mod that transforms every favorite unit into a living story. The mod records births, favorite toggles, battles, injuries, deaths, offspring, grandchildren, and even chats so you can revisit stories long after the units themselves are gone.

## Features

- **Favorite-centric history tracking.** Once a unit is marked as a favorite, a dedicated timeline is created that keeps growing with every major milestone—even after the unit dies.
- **Compatibility patches.** XHM now understands other mods like XNTM (monarch ascensions capture the correct nation-title text such as Sultan/Sultana and note the nation type) and XMM (Orl spell casts and reincarnation jumps are recorded so you can follow sacred souls).

- **Automatic milestone logging.** Birth, kill victories, serious injuries, deaths, offspring, and graduated descendants are captured automatically and time-stamped.

- **Clickable relatives.** Timeline entries that mention family members expose a follow button that jumps the camera to that relative if they are alive.

- **Historybook UI.** A new floating button opens the Historybook menu, showing a scrollable list of favorite units and an infinitely scrollable timeline for each one, plus delete controls.

- **Persistent storage.** Every timeline is saved and survives reloads.

- **Relationship and action dimensionality.** Lovers, births, monarch ascensions, and every significant task a favorite performs are logged with dates and locations so you can trace any plot thread.

- **Exportable Historybooks.** Use the "Export timeline" button to dump a favorite's history to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Worldbox\mods_config\xavii-hxm-historybook\exports`, with the saved path shown in a tooltip.

## Installation

1. Drop the Xavii's Historybook Mod (XHM) folder into the Worldbox/Mods folder managed by NeoModLoader.

2. Launch Worldbox and activate the mod if it is not already enabled.

3. Mark units as favorites in-game to begin building their stories.

I'm looking for a UI artist and a programmer who already know how to work with and extend the existing WorldBox UI (since I don't). If you're interested in joining the project, DM me on Discord. This is NOT a paid project, but you will receive full credit for your work. Also, if you think some translations are too robotic or inaccurate, or a language you want isn't available, feel free to reach out if you'd like to help with translations as well.

Feel free to check out the official discord for this Mod and my many other endeavors.
