# Xavii's We Are Sapient Mod (XWASM)

Grant true sapience to any creature and uplift whole species while keeping their original bodies and sprites. New kingdoms founded by uplifted units use human architecture for buildings by default.

## Features
- **Sapient** actor trait: adds full civilized behavior to a single unit without changing its species.
- **Sapient Species** subspecies trait: uplifts every member of a species at once; cities use human structure art.
- Harmony patches ensure uplifted units can start kingdoms, run cities, and gain all sapient interactions even if their base assets were non-civilized.

## How to use
1. Add the **Sapient** trait to any unit via the traits UI or any mod tool; it immediately gains full civilization rights.
2. Add the **Sapient Species** trait to a subspecies to uplift every member at once.
3. Uplifted founders will create human-styled kingdoms while keeping their native species identity.
