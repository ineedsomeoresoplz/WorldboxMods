# Xavii's Nation Types Mod (XNTM)

Xavii's Nation Types Mod (XNTM) lets you assign descriptive nation archetypes to every kingdom, shaping heir selection, ruler titles, and event wording to feel like an empire, republic, or tribal confederation.

## Features
- 40+ nation types covering monarchies, republics, religious states, city-states, and social models.
- Custom succession logic per nation type (royal clan, elective councils, religious leadership, gerontocracy, anarchy, etc.). Council polities now favor high-diplomacy capital figures and grant militia/loyalty tweaks, while anarchic types bleed loyalty and levies but can spawn crisis warlords.
- Localized ruler/heir titles and log wording that respect the selected archetype.
- **LandTypes (new):** villages, cities, states, and subordinate kingdoms/nations now tag every settlement. Effects include housing caps, militia limits, build pacing, and loyalty bonuses/penalties that respond to the parent nation type (empires can host vassal kingdoms, federations empower states, anarchies strain large realms).
- **AccurateNations (new):** kingdom names are rebuilt with type-specific templates (e.g., "Arios the City-State" or "The Republic of Norun") instead of the vanilla random government words.
- Easy in-game configuration: open any kingdom window and click the "Nation Type" label to cycle through archetypes.
- **BetterWars (new):** wars now start with explicit goals and targets, track side strength over time, pull overlords into defending their puppets, and resolve when goals are fulfilled or momentum stalls. Outcomes include independence breaks, vassalization, annexation of marked cities, mediated peaces, time-boxed ceasefires that reignite, tribute deals, and puppet arrangements; post-war states include occupation, demilitarization, reconstruction, and resentment-driven resistance pulses.

## Usage
1. Select a kingdom and open its Kingdom window.
2. Click Kingdom Editor button, view/set the Nation's traits

## Installation
Copy the entire Xavii's Nation Types Mod (XNTM) folder into your Mods directory so the structure matches Mods/Xavii's Nation Types Mod (XNTM)/mod.json.

## Notes
* Due to *BetterWars*, Wars and Alliance frequency has dropped. Please be aware of this and note that they still work.
